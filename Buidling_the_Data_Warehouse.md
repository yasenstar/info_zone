# 01 Evolution of Decision Support Systems:

# 02 The Data Warehouse Environment

# 03 The Data Warehouse and Design

* There are 2 major components to building a data warehouse:
  1. the design of the interface from operational systems
  2. the design of the data warehouse itself

* The requirements for the data warehouse CANNOT be known until it is **partially populated and in use**, and design apporaches that have worked in the past will not necessarily suffice in subsequent data warehouse.

* Data warehouses are constructed in a heuristic manner, where one phase of development depends entirely on the results attained in the previous phase:
  1. One portion of data is populated.
  2. It is then used and scrutinized by the DSS analyst.
  3. Based on feedback from the end user, the data is modified and/or other data is added.
  4. Another portion of the data warehouse is built, and so forth.
  The feedback loop continues throughout the entire life of the data warehouse.
