# KYC Foundations - Essentials

## Background

The Trocca Case

This is you. You work in Amsterdam, at a financial institution, as a relationship manager. So we’re clear, right? You know who you are.  

This is your boss. She knows who you are, and she knows where you sit.  

Today the boss gives you a file for a new customer account. The file says the account is Trocca. You don’t know Trocca. But you know at that moment you’d rather be where they are, in the Cayman Islands.  

The file contains a copy of Trocca’s articles of incorporation, the date of incorporation, and the business address. In fact, Trocca already has an account with your institution’s affiliate branch in the Cayman Islands. The relationship manager there (does he know how lucky he is) added a note saying that Trocca represents a very important client who values his privacy and his anonymity.  

Trocca wants to transfer 20 million US dollars from its account in the Caymans to a new account in Amsterdam. Your boss is excited because she knows there’s a huge commission to be earned. She wants the best possible customer experience for Trocca because you both know they could take their business—and their big commission check—to your competitor. She tells you to open the account right away.  

So, you know what to do.

The correct choice is to escalate this case to your compliance section.  

Two of the other choices were clearly wrong. You cannot choose to do no research, or choose to wait to do research later, because both of those choices could expose your organization to incredible risk.  

In real life, if you’re a relationship manager, you might be pressured to increase profit at your firm—at the expense of skipping proper compliance steps. But, as the US regulator FinCEN says, “An institution’s interest in revenue should not compromise efforts to effectively manage and mitigate BSA AML deficiencies and risks…”  

The remaining two choices you could make both involve escalating the issue, but to very different groups. The correct answer is to escalate to a group in your organization designed to be independent and not profit-driven. That’s why escalating to your friend is not best. Your friend might be very knowledgeable, but she is not as independent as your compliance group.

Learning Objectives --

- Describe the importance of KYC, the benefits of a RBA, and the recommended KYC process

- Assess what you already know, and what you need to know, about your customer

- Explore where you can find answers to your questions

- Organize the customer information to make it meaningful

- Present the customer information in a manner appropriate to your audience

## Why KYC?

The purpose of having controls to Know Your Customer, also called KYC, is to manage the financial crime risk to your organization. In most jurisdictions, collecting customer information is also a legal and regulatory requirement. The process enables your organization to collect information on customer identity and the key customer risk factors so that you can assess the possibility of money laundering, terrorist financing, economic sanctions breaches, or customer fit that could arise from that relationship or transaction. Most organizations use three risk classification levels for customers – low, medium, and high, or a combination of them.  

Once it has KYC information, your organization can then decide, based on the risk assessment, whether it wants to accept the customer and outline mitigating factors on the identified risks, or decline the business.

### Organizations needs KYC

- Risk-based approach

- Basis of the customer profile

- Monitor future transactions

- Determine if activity is supicious

Organizations that have strong anti-financial crime programs need effective KYC controls to manage risk.  

Your organization will have determined the type of risk it is willing to accept when it does business. This is referred to as the organization's risk appetite. Once that is established, the types of risk those customer and business types will pose to your organization can be identified and classified. These risks are then analyzed to determine the appropriate controls that should be put in place to mitigate and reduce them. __These controls must be appropriate, specific, and risk based.__ Combined, this is known as a risk-based approach.  

Throughout the life of the relationship between your organization and that customer, your organization will rely on the due diligence you complete at this initial stage. Because so much emphasis is placed at the beginning of a relationship, this is the time when criminals might tailor their actions to make them appear legitimate (合法的). Money launderers and terrorist financiers might choose to wait until later to start their more suspicious activities. By undertaking reasonable and comprehensive due diligence at the initial customer acceptance stage, you develop a stronger customer profile for your organization to use later, for example when you monitor transactions to determine if a particular activity is unusual or suspicious. Having a full, complete, and up to date customer profile is essential to understand if activity is in line with expectations for the customer. In most jurisdictions (司法管辖区), there are reporting obligations in place to promptly report any suspicious activities to the authorities.

### Who is your Customer?

- Depends on jurisdiction

- A person or an organization

- User of your products

- Those you deal with regularly

Answering the question, “Who is your customer?” depends upon your jurisdiction, so research your local regulations. A customer can be an individual, listed companies, private companies, joint ventures, partnerships, and financial institutions; basically, anyone who wants to establish a relationship with your organization. If you are a financial institution, the majority of your customers will be account or product holders. They will use products such as remittances and savings accounts, or will hold an insurance policy, or will trade securities. These are people who you or your colleagues might see, speak to, or deal with on a day to day basis.

### Customers comes in many forms --

They can be individuals or entities.  

Corporate entities tend to be more complex and can take many forms. They can be privately-owned companies, publicly-owned companies, trusts, charities, and partnerships.  

A privately-owned company might be owned by a group of natural persons, or it might be owned by another company, or group of companies.  

Publicly-owned companies are quoted on stock exchanges and are collectively owned by shareholders.  

Trusts are set up to control money for beneficiaries. Examples include family trusts or trusts set up for charitable purposes. They are controlled by trustees, who are a group of individuals, or an organization that holds and administers assets for the benefit of a third party.  

Charities are incorporated for a specific purpose and have individuals that are natural persons as their controllers.  

It is likely that all of these customer types buy products or services from your organization. Sometimes your jurisdiction will set thresholds. For example, in one jurisdiction, a person buying a single low-priced product might not be considered a customer. It is essential that your organization define its customer type because jurisdictional requirements might drive everything you do to manage risk, from due diligence at the start through ongoing transaction monitoring, and in every stage of the customer relationship.

### Types of customers in financial services

Financial service customers:

- Natural person (human being)

- Legal person
  
  - Simple or complex
  
  - Company, government, etc.
  
  - Other financial institution

One type is an individual human being, or “natural person”. Natural persons may also be non-resident individuals who have a work or temporary visa.  

Another type is a “legal person.” Corporate entities are considered to be “legal persons.” They come in a variety of forms and can be complex. Some examples of corporate entities are companies, charities, trade unions, pension funds, and financial institutions.  

Government bodies and supranational organizations are also customer types. An example of a government body is Singapore's Ministry of Law. An example of a supranational organization is the World Trade Organization.

### Example customer types

- "Ordinary" person

- Politically exposed person (PEP)

- Companies take different forms
  
  - One shareholder or millions
  
  - Partnership or investment
  
  - Other financial instituion

An ordinary person requiring financial services is easy to identify as a customer type.  

A specific customer type is a politically exposed person, or PEP. A PEP is an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent function. Many PEPs hold positions that can be abused for the purpose of laundering illicit funds or other predicate offences such as corruption or bribery. A person who is a PEP, related to or connected to a PEP, is generally deemed to represent a higher risk for your organization. Your organization will have a policy on how widely you must look for this connection, including relatives and close associates.  

Companies take different forms. They can be incorporated as a limited liability company and have just one shareholder. They can be massive companies held by many investors and quoted on major stock exchanges. What a company does and where it is incorporated will also define its level of risk.  

Partnerships can be a group of individuals, such as a law firm, or investment vehicle set up to hold investor money from many sources.  

Trusts are established to hold the legal title to assets and to control them. They are often higher risk from a financial crime perspective because they can be used to mask the true owner and actual business purpose.  

Financial Institutions include banks, central banks, brokers, exchanges, insurance companies, and money transmission services. They present the full range of risks from low, in the case of many central banks, to high in money transmission services.

## Risk Overview

Types of Risk:

- Regulatory Risk: comes from failing to observe rules and guidance, thus facing fines, restriction of business, and even prison.

- Legal Risk: occurs if an organization breaks laws when doing business or faces a civil lawsuit from dissatisfied customers.

- Financial Risk: comes from the time and money it takes to undergo a regulatory investigation, to defend legal actions, to replace money lost to criminals, or to undergo a criminal prosecution.

- Reputational Risk: comes when an institution is known to have weak controls and thus is targeted by criminals. Reputational risk is difficult to quantify because consumers, shareholders, and local jurisdictions could lose confidence in the institution which could affect profitability.

Organizations that facilitate money laundering or terrorits financing, even if done inadvertently (不经意间), are likely to face all of these risks.

### Risks are often connected

- Regulatory: Multiple jurisdictions

- Legal: Sanctions, tax, AML

- Financial: Fixes, more controls

- Reputational: news and social media

Regulatory risk is complex. Many organizations operate in more than one country and therefore face multiple regulations. Typically, an organization will meet the requirements of its home regulator and make that its global standard. Where necessary, specific local regulations may overlay the global standard. Failure to meet regulatory rules can result in fines, business restrictions, or both.  

Legal risk arises from actions taken by law enforcement authorities in respect of contravention of local laws. A prosecution can be brought for sanctions breaches, assisting a customer to evade taxes, or allowing a customer to launder money through an account with your organization. Civil lawsuits (民事诉讼) can be filed for many reasons, including in response to a regulatory compliance failure.  

Financial risks come from a variety of sources. One example could be the costs of remedying a failed regulatory inspection. Legal costs might arise defending a prosecution for money laundering or defending a claim that personal data collected from customers has not been stored securely.  

Reputation risk is very hard to manage as it can be driven by a news story, including fake news. For example, in the wake of a human trafficking scandal (人口贩卖丑闻), it might be reported that your organization-maintained accounts for the traffickers and did nothing about it. As a result, customers may leave, reducing profitability. It is important to note that reputation risk can be driven by the intended actions of an organization, such as opening credit card accounts for customers without their consent.

### Regulations related to KYC

- Broadest global regulations
  
  - USA: Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)
  
  - EU: AML Directives (5th)
  
  - UK: Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Regulation (2019)

- "Extraterritorial" (治外法权)

Every country has regulations to prevent money laundering, bribery and corruption, fraud, tax evasion, and terrorist financing. Globally, the most overreaching regulations have been issued by the US, the European Union, and the United Kingdom.  

The Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, is the primary US anti-money laundering regulation. In the European Union, it is the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive. In the United Kingdom, it is The Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Regulation 2019.  

Many regulations have extraterritorial reach, meaning they apply even outside the country that issued them. Your organization will need to comply with these regulations as well as those of your home regulator.

### Laws and Guidance

- US: BSA, PATRIOT Act, FCPA

- EU: Series of AML Directives

- Financial Action Task Force (FATF)

- UK: MLTF, Bribery Act (贿赂法)

- Hong Kong: AMLO

In the USA, the BSA covers anti-money laundering, and has been amended to include certain provisions of Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act to detect, deter, and disrupt terrorist financing networks.  

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or FCPA, prohibits US companies and individuals from paying bribes to foreign officials in furtherance of a business deal. It has extraterritorial reach.

The European Union developed its 5th Money Laundering Directive based in-part on the following:

- A significant change in terrorist attacks in Europe over the previous five years

- The Panama Papers leaks, which identified the extent to which offshore accounts are used to disguise beneficial ownership

- The adoption of cryptocurrencies and other digital channels for money laundering, which are currently unregulated sectors

The EU’s intent is to ensure the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, anti-money laundering recommendations are implemented. FATF is an inter-governmental body that sets international standards that aim to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing and the harm they cause to society.  

The UK’s Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Regulations 2019 is wider than the EU Directive. It requires organizations to include new additional high-risk factors when assessing the need for enhanced due diligence, to seek additional information, and to increase monitoring in certain cases.  

The Bribery Act 2010 is UK legislation that also has extraterritorial reach.  

An example of a regional regulation is the Hong Kong Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance, AMLO, that highlights internal controls, processes, considerations, monitoring, and reporting requirements on covered persons and entities.

## Risk Categories

### 4 Categories of Risk

- Customer

- Jurisdiction

- Product

- Channel

An overall customer risk rating is usually derived as a composite of the following four categories of risk in money laundering prevention: Customer, Jurisdiction, Product, and Channel.  

The risk associated with the customer can be higher if the customer is nonresident, if the customer’s legal structure is complex, if the customer is in an industry often exploited for (被利用) financial crime, or if the customer’s business is cash-intensive.  

Some jurisdictions are higher risk because their own laws, regulations, and enforcement controls to prevent financial crime are weak, or nonexistent.  

Each product or service carries a different level of risk. For example, private banking is considered higher risk, as transactions may be confidential and attempt to mask true ownership.  

Channel risk increases with non-face-to-face business relationships or transactions, or when payments are sent to or received from unknown or unassociated third parties.

### Examples of higher risks

- Customer: Non-resident, complex owner

- Jurisdiction: Low regulation, tax haven

- Product: Prepaid card, private banking

- Channel: No direct relationship with customer

Customers can be higher risk if they use nominee shareholders, shares in bearer form, or a company ownership structure that is very complex. In many countries, bearer shares are banned because of their potential for abuse as tax evasion and money laundering. Also, high risk are customers who conduct their business relationship with your organization at a geographic distance, which is not explained. For example, a foreign citizen, with no connection to a country where an account is being opened, requires explanation. Your organization might have a list of industries or customer types considered higher-risk which automatically get additional scrutiny.  

Higher risk jurisdictions, as defined by the **Financial Action Task Force**, are countries that have been identified as having strategic deficiencies in their national anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regimes. They pose significant threats to the global financial system.  

Certain products are higher risk. An example would be reloading a prepaid device via a kiosk at a gas station. Others are lower risk. An example is providing a small amount of foreign currency to an existing customer for a holiday abroad.  

Some delivery channels are higher risk. Correspondent banking relationships create significant money laundering and terrorist financing risks because the domestic bank carrying out the transaction has to rely on the foreign bank to identify the customer, determine the real owners, and monitor such transactions for risks.

### Customer Risk and Red Flags

- Who, what they do, source of funds or wealth

- Example: Cash-intensive business might deposit drug cash

- Unexpected behavior is red flag

Some customers present higher inherent risk to your organization because of who they are, what they do, the industry they are in, the businesses they run, or their source of funds or wealth. Look for a business model that could bring cash from illegal drug sales into the financial system, such as a car wash or other typically cash-intensive business.  

Look for activity that is inconsistent with their expected behavior. For example, a natural person who is a paralegal  (律师助理) is paid every two weeks via direct deposit for US\$2,000. If she later transfers US\$144,000 into the account from an outside account, it would raise a red flag. The source of funds and source of wealth must be explained and verified.  

Other red flags could include indicators of money mules, fraud, or performing banking transactions on behalf of others who do not wish their true identity to be known.

### Assessing Customer Risk

- Status and profession

- Type and size of business

- Industry

- Uncooperative when asked questions

- Red flags are not always permanent

When assessing the risk posed by a customer, it is important to check their status and what they do. A customer who frequently visits a bank branch to change small denomination bank notes for larger ones raises a red flag. Illegal drug sales are often cash-based, small transactions. What does the customer do? Is there a good reason for this activity?  

Actions inconsistent with the customer’s business also warrant attention. Red flags might include a sudden change in the currency transaction patterns of a business which is inconsistent with its normal activities. Or a retail business that has dramatically different patterns of cash deposits from similar businesses in the same general location. Or a business with no apparent or significant online sales which receives large frequent payments from an online payments system.  

Certain industries are often exploited by financial criminals. Examples include charities, high-value goods dealers, casinos, and real estate agents. There is usually not one shared attribute about those industries that makes them higher-risk, so using a list of them to guide your risk assessment is a best practice.  

Any customer who will not cooperate, or who refuses to provide satisfactory proof of how the source of funds or source of wealth was obtained, raises a further red flag.  

Not all red flags are permanent. You might discover, for example, that your customer has the same name as someone who is listed on an official register for crimes or sanctions. If, after further investigation, you confirm that your customer is not on that register, you can clear the red flag.

### Politically Exposed Person (PEP, 政治公众人物) Risk and Red Flags

A PEP is a politically exposed person. According to Financial Action Task Force (FATF) there are two types of PEPs:

- Foreign PEPs are individuals who are or have been entrusted (委托) with prominent (著名的) public functions by a foreign country

- Domestic PEPs are individuals who are or have been entrusted domestically with prominent public functions

PEPs tend to be heads of state or heads of government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state-owned corporations, and important political party officials. Usually, PEP positions are specified in each jurisdiction's AML regulation.  

Immediate family members, relatives, and close associates may also be classified as PEPs.

### PEPs are high-risk

Individuals in high positions and their associates are more vulnerable to corruption.  

Corruption might be quid-pro-quo favors (交换条件) where the PEP directs government contracts to an organization in return for kickbacks. In addition, a PEP might influence legislation for bribes, or even flee the country with government funds.  

In defining a PEP, it is wise to use a broad definition that includes the positions that make a person a PEP, as well as their immediate family members and close associates.  

Under a risk-based approach, PEP risk is manageable. If a customer discloses during the KYC, or Know Your Customer process, that he is the husband of a government official, it may be wise to classify him as a PEP regardless of whether he would qualify under your institution's PEP definition. This will depend on your organization’s internal policies. The additional expenditure of resources will often be justified by the protection you get from the investigation.  

When it comes to identifying PEPs, your organization only needs to use the information which is both in your possession and publicly known. Depending on the size of your organization, this may also include the use of a proprietary database for name **screening**.

### Shell Company risk and Red flags

- No assets or operations

- "Shelf" is shell created to use later

- Appear legitimate and mask ownership

- Sometimes legitimate but high-risk

- Often facilitate money laundering

A shell company or corporation is a company that, at the time of incorporation, has no significant assets or operations. A similarly named "shelf" company is a corporation that has had no activity. It has been created and put "on the shelf" so that it can be sold later to someone who prefers a previously registered corporation over a new one. Both shell and shelf companies are generally kept dormant, and are used later to appear legitimate, while masking the beneficial owner. While there are legitimate uses for shell companies, within the context of researching and accepting customers, shell and shelf companies are considered high-risk.  

Shell companies can be established with the primary objective to claim the proceeds of crime as legitimate revenue or to commingle criminal proceeds with legitimate revenue. According to Financial Action Task Force, the use of shell companies to facilitate money laundering is a well-documented typology.

### Shell company is high-risk

- Sometimes "offshore"

- Complex ownership

- Legally registered

- Corporate servfice providers

- Bearer shares identify owner

- Concealed (暗) by secrecy (保密) laws

Shell companies can be set up in onshore and offshore locations.

Their ownership structures can take several forms

- Shares can be issued to a natural or legal person or in registered or bearer form

- Some shell companies can be created for a single purpose or to hold a single asset

- Some shell companies can be established as multipurpose entities

Shell companies are often legally incorporated and registered by the criminal organization but have no legitimate business purpose. Often purchased from lawyers, accountants or non-reputable corporate service providers, they are convenient vehicles to launder money.  

Sometimes, the stock of these shell corporations is issued in bearer shares, which means that whoever carries them is the purported owner. Tax haven countries and their strict secrecy laws can further conceal the true ownership of shell corporations. In addition, the information may be held by professionals who claim secrecy.  

When FATF reviewed the rules and practices that impair the effectiveness of money laundering prevention and detection systems, it found in particular that shell corporations and nominees are widely used mechanisms to launder the proceeds from crime. As a result, shell companies are considered to represent a higher risk of financial crime.

### Jurisdiction Risk and Red Flags

- Corrupt, unstable governments

- Secrecy, tax, laundering havens (避风港)

- Drug production and cartels (合作社)

- Inadequate AML/CFT controls

Certain countries or jurisdictions have high levels of corruption or unstable governments. Some are known as secrecy and money laundering havens or suffer from high levels of drug production and cartel activities. It’s important to consider the inherent risk in the jurisdictions where you do business.

Jurisdictions with higher risk include those

- With poor anti-money laundering regulations

- With high levels of corruption

- With inadequate regulatory and judicial frameworks to prevent terror-financing

- That are subject to economic sanctions

- That are considered to be tax havens

- That host shell companies

Examples include tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands, or the Cayman Islands. Other examples include whole countries, such as North Korea.

### Sources for assessing jurisdiction risk

- Transparency International

- US International Narcotics Control Strategy Report

- Sanctions and terror lists

- FATF member or regional body

- Regional risks

You should look for red flags related to jurisdiction risk. Excellent sources include Transparency International’s “Corruption Perceptions Index” and the US State Department’s annual International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, which rates countries based on their money laundering controls and corruption.  

You should review sanctions and terrorist financing lists published by governments and international organizations such as OFAC, HM Treasury in the UK, the UN Security Council, the US FinCEN, and the EU.  

Determine if the country is a member of Financial Action Task Force or of a FATF-style regional body, and has implemented practices in line with international standards.  

Take into account regional risks inside a particular country, such as port cities, free trade zones, the cross-border areas between nations, or designated areas of high intensity financial crime or drug trafficking. If the countries where you operate do not provide information on such high-risk crime areas, you can research your own list from media and other available sources.

### Product Risk and Red Flags

- High inherent risk
  
  - Private bank source of funds

- Higher risk if used in a certai way
  
  - Quickly cancelled / refunded
  
  - Paid for by third parties

Some financial products carry a higher risk when used by customers in a certain way.  

For example, private wealth services assist to manage the funds of wealthy customers. If a customer is also a politically exposed person, a red flag is raised. This is because their wealth might not be justifiable and might have been obtained through bribery, corruption, or theft.  

Financial products that are paid for immediately but can be cancelled within a certain period for a full refund are high risk. An insurance policy that is redeemed too soon should raise a red flag.  

Third parties making or receiving payments raise a red flag. Criminals often use third parties to make payments on their behalf as a way of disguising the sources of funds.

### Assessing product risk

- Coverting cash into other forms

- Selling long term products quickly - even for a loss

- Third-party involvement

Customers buying large value pre-paid cards might raise a red flag unless there is a good reason.  

Longer term investment products, which are liquid and can be bought and sold easily, raise a red flag if the customer does not hold them for long and is unconcerned about losses.  

Trade finance, which is the provision of financing or credit for trade transactions, is a high-risk product. Red flags are raised if a payment to the seller is made by an unrelated third party. For example, the customer might misclassify the commodity, over value or under value it.

### Product risk - Case example

- Potential private bank customer wants to buy stocks
  
  - US\$250,000 property sale
  
  - US\$9,000 cash from income

- Red Flags: PEP, structuring, cash deposits

The private banking department opens an investment account for a new customer. He has control of the portfolio, and your organization advises him. He wants to buy highly liquid stocks and shares. He deposits US$250,000 from a property sale now, from another bank, and says he will add US$9,900 in cash, every month going forward. His identity is verified. He is the Inspector of Buildings for the state department of works. This is a local government position. He is responsible for signing the fire safety certificates for large building developments. He says the money for the monthly deposit will come from private consultancy work he undertakes for major construction companies. Despite these explanations, and verified identity, there are red flags. He might be a politically exposed person, due to his position with the local government. His monthly payments must be challenged.

Private banking is a high-risk product because it tends to attract high net worth customers who value their privacy. Some private banking customers could be PEPs.  

While the amount he uses to open the account can be verified by inquiry, the monthly cash deposit is a red flag. Many jurisdictions have a cap on how much money can be deposited or withdrawn in cash before a currency transaction report must be made. In your jurisdiction, the limit is US$10,000. The customer wishes to deposit an amount just below this. Is this deliberate?  

The customer holds an important role in local government. That could make him a senior government official, and therefore a politically exposed person, and high risk.  

The customer has been very open about what he does. Could he be accepting bribes from the construction companies to give the fire safety certificates without making the proper checks and disguising it as advisory fees?  

Do you think it unusual for a senior expert giving specialist advice to a major company to be paid in cash and in such a large amount?  

The customer’s identity has been verified. You can allocate him PEP status in your records. You must ask for proof of the property sale, a copy of the contract for his advisory services, and permission from his employer to take on separate employment.  

Note that being a PEP is not a crime and should not be treated as such. The risk presented to the firm by a PEP is higher; therefore, additional controls may be applied.

### Channel Risk and Red Flags

- Risk from sale or delivery method

- Risk increases
  
  - Non-face-to-face
  
  - Transactions with unknown 3rd parties

Channel risk is the inherent risk posed by the method in which an institution’s products are delivered. It is also known as delivery channel risk. Channel risk increases with non-face-to-face business relationships or transactions or when payments are sent to or received from unknown or unassociated third parties.

### Assessing Channel Risk

- Higher risk if identity obscured

- Higher risk if different standards

- Maintain confidentiality

Other examples of high-risk delivery channels include

- Correspondent banks, payable through accounts, and concentration accounts

- Remote transactions

You need to include additional risk arising from channels in your Customer Risk Rating Model.

If your organization allows for customers to open accounts without being physically present, then additional controls are needed to mitigate the risk of identity fraud or deception. Here are some criteria taken from the European Union’s Anti-Money Laundering Directive:

- Establish the customer’s identity by additional documents, data, or information

- Add verification measures, including certification of documents by another organization

- Require that the first payment to the account is from an account held by that customer at an organization subject to the same standard of controls—maybe even at a sister branch

- Never agree to open accounts for fictitious, anonymous, or numbered entities. However, privacy is a right and regulatory obligation in many jurisdictions. Organizations should limit the employees who know which customers have accounts. Furthermore, employees are not allowed to share account holder identities with family, friends, or even coworkers unless on a need-to-know basis.

## Risk-Based Approach (RBA)

### RBA to Business

Risk Appetite: Every organization has its own appetite for risk. This determines the type of customer it will accept, the types of product it will offer, and the jurisdictions in which it will do business.  

Risk-Rating: Once this is established, the organization will allocate a risk rating to these categories. For example, an individual customer with a regular job and a salary opening a savings account would be low risk, assuming the source of funds can be corroborated and there is no relevant, negative news. A Politically Exposed Person, or PEP, is higher risk. Products and jurisdictions also present a range of risks.  

Use Resources Wisely: Using a risk-based approach allows your organization to effectively use its resources by classifying customers based on the level of perceived risk that they could pose from a financial crime perspective.  

Those decisions drive the level and frequency of customer research and updating the customer profile.

### RBA is now a regulatory expectation

Risk Assessment: Risk assessment as a whole has become more important in recent years because the fight against financial crime has taken a more holistic approach, with regulators emphasizing a risk-based approach to every way you interact with your customers.  

Risk Level: Accurately judging the risk level that a customer might be involved in laundering money is an important prerequisite for the “risk-based” approach. Financial institutions need to conduct due diligence on business operations, industries, customer characteristics, and regions, in order to obtain adequate, complete, and truthful customer information as the basis of analysis.  

Focus Effort: A risk-based approach focuses effort where it is most needed and will have most impact. It requires the full commitment and support of senior management, and the active cooperation of all employees.  

Manage Risk: Adopting a risk-based approach implies the adoption of a risk-management process for dealing with money laundering and terrorist financing. This process encompasses recognizing the existence of the risks, undertaking an assessment of the risks, and developing control strategies to mitigate and monitor the identified risks.  

Mitigate the Highest Risks: Money laundering risk is just one element of risk financial institutions face. Others include credit risk and market risk. Combining the management of these risks enables risk managers to assess the financial crime risk and devote resources to mitigating the highest risks.

### Controlling Risk

- Controls are critical to success

- Risk assessment guides controls

- 3 categories: Preventive, Detective, Corrective

Controlling risk is critical to the overall success of an institution. Financial crime risk assessments help to develop control strategies to mitigate and monitor the identified risks. Some examples of these control strategies are policies and procedures, training, four eyes checks, and segregation of duties. These controls fall into three categories: preventive, detective, and corrective.

### Internal Control Framework

An internal control framework is the process through which an organization obtains reasonable assurance that it is achieving its objectives in relation to its operations, reporting, and compliance.  

The five components of the internal control framework are the overall control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring.  

The overall control environment is the set of standards, processes, and structures that provide the basis for carrying out internal control across the organization.  

A money laundering risk assessment measures the likelihood or probability that the business will unwittingly engage in money laundering or terror financing. The risk assessment identifies inherent risks, the effectiveness of existing controls, and captures the residual risk.  

Control activities in financial crime prevention include preventive, detective, and corrective controls.

- Preventive controls include robust due diligence, record keeping, and record retention.

- Detective controls include reporting suspicious activity to the appropriate authorities.

- Corrective controls include the eventual exiting of a customer relationship where necessary.  

Information and communication include proper training for employees, third-party providers, and the board of directors. Regular updates should be given when money laundering typologies evolve, so that front line staff know what to look for.  

The final element of risk control is monitoring. This is usually undertaken by a separate department (such as Internal Audit) or independent assurance within the business or the compliance lines, who will test that all policies, procedures, and controls have been properly observed and applied.

### Residual risk equation

Residual risk = Inherent risk - Controlled risk

Financial institutions measure risk by conducting a risk assessment.  

You can use the equation: Inherent Risk – Controlled Risk = Residual Risk  

Inherent risk is the risk before controls are applied. Inherent risk generally takes into account the risk factors of Customer, Jurisdiction, Product, and Channel.  

All of that comes together to create inherent risk (固有风险).  

The next part of the equation is Controlled Risk. Your organization has many controls, including customer due diligence, governance, training, adequate staffing, testing, and transaction monitoring.  

Residual risk is the risk that remains after you implement effective controls.

### Inherent Risks and Controls

To understand inherent risk, it is important to know the specific risks associated with each risk factor.  

1. Customer: Customer risk can be higher if the customer is a non-resident, if the customer’s legal structure is complex, or if the customer’s business is cash-intensive.  

2. Jurisdiction: Jurisdictions with higher risk include those with poor anti-money laundering regulations or areas with high levels of corruption.  

3. Product: Each product or service carries a different level of risk. For example private banking is considered higher risk, as transactions may be confidential in an attempt to mask true ownership.  

4. Channel: Channel risk increases with non-face-to-face business relationships or transactions, or when payments are sent to or received from unknown or unassociated third parties.  

Your organization has established a set of controls to help mitigate inherent risk. **KYC controls include customer identification, customer due diligence, management approvals, and dual controls**. In addition, your organization should have carefully documented policies and procedures, and carefully documented research to know your customer.

### RBA to KYC (Initial and Ongoing)

- Identify risk from each customer

- Defined by your risk appetite

- High, medium, low, and perhaps more

- KYC is ongoing

A risk-based approach to KYC helps you identify the risks each customer brings to your organization in respect to possible money laundering and terrorist financing risk. **The risk-based approach is defined by your organization’s risk appetite (风险偏好), or the level of risk your organization is willing to accept based on its strategic objectives.**

The risk-based approach categorizes customers into levels of risk: such as high, medium, low, and perhaps more levels based on the policies of your organization. The level of risk determines the amount and type of due diligence you must do.

KYC is an ongoing effort. Your institution will have risk-based time frames for conducting periodic reviews. For example, customers might be reviewed annually if they are high risk, at two years for medium risk, and every three years if they are low risk. The frequency will vary based on your organization's policies.

### Risk-based KYC benefits

- Regulators advise RBA

- Resource allocation

- Ongoing reviews ensure risk classification is appropriate

Regulators want you to apply a risk-based approach. They want you to understand your customer because you have done a sufficient amount of research, and you have documented all that research.  

The risk-based approach sets out the process for you to collect information about the identity of the customer and the key customer risk factors, and to assess the risk that could arise from that relationship or transaction.  

An example is the due diligence required for opening a simple checking account. Without a risk-based approach, a senior citizen from New York wanting to deposit his pension checks would be subject to the same due diligence process as a politically exposed person who is part of a foreign government wanting to deposit a large amount of funds.  

**KYC does not end after onboarding a customer**. Depending on the risk classification of the customer, there should be ongoing monitoring of customer transactions and a regular, periodic review of the customer's profile. Note that customers might not remain in the same risk category throughout their relationship with your organization. For example, an ordinary individual might run for local government office and, if elected, become a PEP. That would change their risk classification from low to medium or high, based upon the role they perform.

## KYC Process Overview

### Following organization-specific policies and prcedures

- Guide due diligence, screening, transaction monitoring, controls

- Guide suspicious transactions reports

- Manage risk

It is important that you follow your organization’s specific policies and procedures. These are designed to ensure that the appropriate due diligence is performed on all customers. They ensure that there is appropriate name screening, transaction monitoring, and other controls. They provide the procedure for reporting suspicious transactions. Added together, policies and procedures are designed to prevent bad actors from using your organization for criminal activities. They also protect you and your organization from regulatory criticism or possible action by the law enforcement agencies. Failure to follow them, or efforts to avoid them, could result in disciplinary action from your employer, or penalties to your institution from the regulator.

In order to follow the policies and procedures, need

- Know where to find and apply

- Regular training

- Onboarding is key

- Suspicious activity reporting

- Assess if policies and procedures are adequate and followed

In order for staff to follow their organization’s specific policies and procedures, they must know where to find them and how to apply them. A policy sets out the principles of action to be used by an organization. A process is a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular outcome. A procedure is an established way of doing something.  

Training on policies and procedures must be given and refreshed at appropriate intervals. Important changes to, or new, policies must be communicated. Consequences for failure to follow policies and procedures must be clear to staff at all levels.  

A clearly defined policy and process for onboarding customers, with appropriate four eyes checks, will protect the organization and employees from criticism. It is important that documentation and records are maintained to demonstrate compliance.  

Staff who deal with suspicious activity alerts must be rigorous in applying the organization’s policies and procedures when handling alerts. Regulators will often call for such records to test the organization’s financial crime prevention procedures.  

If policies and procedures get in the way of legitimate transactions, and frequent breaches or exceptions are made simply to complete those transactions, your organization should assess whether the policies and procedures are adequate and productive. If it was discovered that the violations were willful, there must be consequences for the individuals concerned. That is a regulatory expectation.

### Four research steps

1. **Access** what you need

2. **Explore** to find answers

3. **Organize** to make meaningful

4. **Present** to information and defend

First, you should assess what you already know, and the knowledge gaps you need to fill. Start by determining what you need at the end, so you can use your resources wisely.  

Second, you should explore to find the answers you need about the situation and those involved.  

Third, organize your information in a meaningful way. Decide what is relevant and important.  

In the final step, present the results based upon what you know about the customer.

The four steps loop --

- As you **Organize**, you find gaps

- If needed, **Explore** more

- **Present** is most important

- Avoid doing redundant work

- Be a good business partner

You can see how these four steps loop around. First you assess, then you explore, and as you organize your information, you can better assess gaps. Sometimes that pushes you back to the explore step. An example of this is enhanced due diligence. At first, during standard due diligence, you thought you knew enough about the customer. But when organizing your information, you realized that this customer deserved a deeper look, so you did enhanced due diligence by exploring some more to get a better picture of the customer.  

The final step, where you present the results based upon what you know about the customer, might be the most important. Several audiences will rely on the hard work you have done. The present step is where you document, persuade, and defend your research choices in ways that meet the needs of all your audiences—now and over the life of the relationship with this customer.  

Make sure you don’t do redundant work. Regulators want you to be thorough, but your organization’s business staff wants to ensure that the compliance process is easy for your customers. Keep your organization’s limited budget and staff in mind. Be a compliant and good business partner who creates a positive customer experience.  

Used together, these four steps will help you to be more effective and efficient.

### Duty to report

- Organizatgion must report suspicious behavior

- Personal liability

- Clear policies ensure clear reporting

- Designated officer is responsible

If an organization suspects that a customer is laundering money, or committing other types of financial crime, it has a duty to report it to the authorities. In many countries, there is a personal liability to report money laundering, and there are legal penalties of fines and imprisonment if you do not do so. However, your organization will have clearly defined policies and procedures to ensure reporting is clear and factual, and to protect you. Around the world, organizations appoint officers to be responsible for anti-money laundering programs. The title may be the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), AML Officer, Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO), the Principal Officer (PO), Chief Anti Money Laundering Compliance Officer (CAMLCO), or a title reflective of the jurisdiction.

Suspicious activity reporting:

- Legal consequences

- "Willful blindness"

- Policies guide reporting

- Designated officer decides

- Reports are defense if an investigation

In many countries, there are legal consequences for individuals who are proved to have failed to report money laundering or are suspected of money laundering. These range from heavy fines to imprisonment. In some jurisdictions, an individual can be prosecuted for “willful blindness,” which will be judged on the circumstances surrounding the transaction and the defendant’s conduct. Courts define willful blindness as the “deliberate avoidance of knowledge of the facts” and have held that willful blindness is the equivalent of actual knowledge of the illegal source of funds or of the intentions of a customer in a money laundering transaction.  

It is important that organizations put in place policies and procedures to enable staff to report their suspicions to an assigned compliance officer. Staff must be properly trained in these procedures to ensure that both they, and your organization, meet the duty to report requirement. The assigned compliance officer will be responsible for assessing the information and deciding what actions must be taken. The process might stop following the escalation of the potentially suspicious activity because the compliance officer considers the activity or explanation to be sufficient. If the facts indicate an external report must be made, the most usual action is the submission of a suspicious activity report (SAR) to the relevant authority in the jurisdiction. Reporting within agreed timelines ensures that the individual and the organization effectively discharge their responsibilities. Some jurisdictions may require unusual activities to be reported, in addition to those which are deemed suspicious.

### Tipping off (小费)

- Criminal offense - fines or prison

- Neve disclose information

- Never tell the customer

- Filling a SAR properly can protect you

"Tipping off" is a criminal offense, for which you can be fined or even imprisoned. It occurs when a person discloses to any other person, information or any other matter, which is likely to prejudice (偏见) a money laundering investigation. This means you must not tell the customer, or anyone else who does not need to know, that they are the subject of a suspicious activity report (SAR) or criminal investigation. Most jurisdictions provide immunity, or safe harbor, to the filing institution and its employees.

- Everyone who contacts customers must understand this law

- Jurisdictions vary

- Data protection law are relevant

- Often permission to conduct the account will be granted

It is important that front line staff understand the "tipping off" offense, because it is likely that they will be the people explaining to a customer why there is a delay in processing a transaction or request. Such explanations are best handled under the direction of the MLRO or nominated AML Officer.  

When a SAR has been filed each institution will have a specific policy and a process. Anyone who contacts a customer should have received training on how to handle this type of customer contact, and fully understand the sensitivity and responsibility of not “tipping off” the customer about a possible SAR filing. In addition, your institution needs to observe local data protection and legislative requirements. Financial institutions cannot mention anything concerning a SAR, the fact that they are considering filing one, or that they have filed one. In some jurisdictions, the unauthorized disclosure of a SAR is a criminal offense.  

In many cases, permission to continue normal business activities with the account would be granted so as not to alert the bad actors that an investigation is underway. In these situations, it is important that the way the business is conducted does not change, as this itself could be construed as "tipping off."  

A record detailing actions that the organization and its nominated officers have taken should be kept.

## Review Questions

**What is the purpose of KYC?**

Answer: To manage the risk posed by customers.

Explanation: Ultimately, the overall purpose of KYC is to manage the risk posed by customers. This is accomplished by understanding the customer and activity, documenting information, and assigning a risk score—all of which are used to manage the overall risk a customer presents to the organization.

**A customer can be a natural person or a legal person.**

Answer: TRUE.

Explanation: Customers can be individuals such as natural persons; or legal persons such as a trusts, government bodies, corporations, LLCs, or partnerships.

**When a customer has the same name as someone who is listed on an official register for crimes or sanctions, you always:**

Answer: Make further inquiries to discover whether this is your customer.

Explanation: Making further inquiries will allow you to determine if there is a true match. You should check date of birth, middle names, aliases, locations, and carefully review the source of the match to determine whether this is your customer.

**All geographic jurisdictions have the same risk:**

Answer: FALSE

Explanation: Even counties within a given state might have a different risk profile, depending on the level of corruption or criminal activity. In the United States, for example, a list of high intensity financial crime areas and high intensity drug trafficking areas are available by county. These jurisdictions are at a higher risk than counties without such designations.

**Which of the following is not a high-risk delivery channel?**

Answer: Opening an account in person

Explanation: Face-to-face transactions are the most secure delivery channel. The identity of the conductor can be seen and verified. The further you are from the customer, the higher the risk.

**Which is not a step of the risk management processes for AML?**

Answer: Considering the dollar value fo the portfolio the customer will bring to the bank.

Explanation: The dollar value that the customer is bringing to the bank is not relevant to the risk assessment process. Considering the source of wealth and source of funds of the money is relevant—but the amount should not sway the risk-assessment.

Other three choices are all the steps of the Risk Management Processes:

- Assessing the inherent risks

- Developoing control strategies to mitigate and monitor the identified risks

- Recognizing the existence of the inherent risks

**What is the purpose of the financial crime risk assessment?**

Answer: Measure the likelihood that the business will unwittingly engage in money laundering or terror financing

Explanation: The risk assessment is intended to evaluate the customer types, policies, and procedures of the financial institution. It can assist in identifying gaps or missed opportunities in the financial institution's AML program. By evaluating the risks and stated controls, a program can have a risk-based approach to customers and products.

**What are the three categories for control strategies?**

Answer: Preventive, Detective, Corrective

Explanation: The three types of control strategies are preventive, detective, and corrective. We seek first to prevent financial crimes, then detect suspicious activities and report them appropriately, and implement corrective controls, such as potentially exiting a customer relationship, when necessary.

**The residual risk equation is Control Effectiveness - Inherent Risk = Residual Risk**

Answer: FALSE

Explanation: The residual risk equation is Inherent Risk – Controlled Risk = Residual Risk. We start this analysis by looking at the amount of risk, and then we subtract mitigating controls.

**Why is a risk-based approach important?**

Anser: So you can apply appropriate scrutiny (审查) based on the risk presented to you by a given customer

Explanation: With a risk-based approach, a senior citizen wishing to deposit a pension check in her name will require less due diligence than a new money service business wishing to begin operations or a non-resident alien who wishes to open a bank account. The risk-based approach allows resources to be directed to the place where there is the highest risk of a problem.

**What is the four eyes check?**

Answer: Ensuring that at least two people review the informationm collected.

Explanation: At least two people should review the information collected to ensure that things make sense: the original person who takes the information, and at least one other individual.

**Which of the following is not one of the 4 research steps to improve the quality of KYC research?**

Answer: Verify

Explanation: The final research step is "Present." This includes documentation of the information found, which will be utilized by others researching suspicious activity, auditors, and regulators in assessing the efficacy of the program. Proper documentation can prevent repetitive and redundant work by documenting previous findings.

Memo: Assess -> Explore -> Organize -> Present

**An organization has a duty to report which of the following?**

Answer: If there is a suspicion that a customer is laundering money or committing other types of financial crimes.

Explanation: Depending on your jurisdiction, a suspicious activity report should be filed when there is reason to suspect that money laundering or illicit activity is occurring, or when there is no apparent business purpose to the activity and an investigation does not clear up concerns.

# KYC Foundations - Assess

Learning Objective: Assess what you already know and what you need to know about your customer

## Access Step Introduction

Assess = to ask, plan and prepare

The first step in the four-step research model is to assess what you already know about the customer and what knowledge gaps you need to fill. Start your research by knowing what you need at the end, and by planning how to use your resources wisely. Avoid doing too much research, repeating what others have done, or unnecessary detail. Balance your need to be compliant with your organization’s need to provide a positive customer experience. By taking time to properly assess your needs, and by doing only what you need to do, you can be both compliant and a good business partner.

The Assess Step saves time on

- Where to find the best information

- What inforation is relevant

- How much detail to include

- Specific answers required

- How much research is enough

The time you invest now, at the start of the process, will make the rest of your decisions during research more efficient and more effective.  

Obviously, it’s easier to choose where to find the best information after you’ve assessed what types of information you need. If at this point you develop a list of what you already know, then you can reduce the amount of work still left to do. You’ll be able to more easily sort out information that isn’t relevant or important because it doesn’t fill one of the gaps you identified. Often during research you’ll find way more detail than you can manage—and way more detail that any of your future audiences will have time to read. The Assess step helps you identify how much detail to include—and, even better—the specific answers your organization, or your external audiences, requires you to provide. In a way you can pre-sort information even before you find it, just because you’ll know as you research what you need and what you don’t—and what others have already found before you.  

Perhaps the best benefit of the Assess step is that, if you plan well at the start, then you’ll know when you’ve reached the end. You will avoid doing “too much” or “too little” research, but just enough to satisfy each of your important audiences.

## What do we need to know about our customers?

### Three Lines of Defence:

1. The first line of defense is the line of business. Also known as the front line, these customer-facing employees are best-equipped to get the information you need for your customer due diligence. Operations, risk, and control teams that support the business may also be referred to as the first line of defense.  

2. The second line of defense is the compliance and internal control functions. That includes the chief money laundering reporting officer, or MLRO, in charge of managing and monitoring AML and CFT activities. Members of the second line of defense should not be incentivized to receive a direct share of business profits.  

3. The third line of defense is internal audit. They perform an independent review of the controls applied by the first two lines of defense.

### Responsibility of Each Line:

- Front line implements policies

- Compliance (directed by MLRO)
  
  - Develops policies
  
  - Escalated issues to the board
  
  - Reports suspicious activity

- Internal autid evaluates controls

The line of business is responsible for implementing and maintaining policies and procedures, as well as communicating these to all personnel. It must also establish processes for screening employees to ensure high ethical and professional standards and deliver appropriate training on AML policies and procedures based on roles and functions performed.

The AML compliance function is the second line of defense. The AML officer is responsible for developing policies to ensure AML compliance and to enable the escalation of identified noncompliance or other issues to senior management and, where appropriate, the board. The AML officer should be the contact point for all AML issues for internal and external authorities and should have the responsibility for reporting suspicious transactions. The AML officer must have sufficient independence from the business lines to prevent conflicts of interest.

The audit function should report to the audit committee of the board of directors, or equivalent, and independently evaluate the risk management and controls of the bank through periodic assessments. These include:

- The adequacy of the bank’s controls to mitigate the identified risks

- The effectiveness of the bank staff’s execution of the controls

- The effectiveness of the compliance oversight and quality controls

- The effectiveness of the training

The audit function must have knowledgeable employees with sufficient audit expertise.

### Intended Audiences

What read the KYC customer profilt, and why?

Customer profile is the end result --

- Clearly identify the customer

- Nature and intended purpose of the account

- Source of funds

- Other information for customer risk rating model

The end result of your KYC research is to produce a customer profile that will clearly identify the customer, the nature and intended purpose of the account, the source of funds, and other customer information useful in your customer risk rating model. In the Assess step, you need to know who your intended audience is, and what they need to know. There are multiple audiences that you need to satisfy.

### Know your audience

- Regulators: Regulators will review KYC files to determine whether you are complying with your jurisdiction’s laws and regulations and whether you are collecting enough information to enable your organization to effectively detect and identify suspicious activity.

- Other government officials: Other government officials may look at your work.

- Law enforcement: Law enforcement might evaluate your work. When your organization files a suspicious activity report (SAR or STR), that often uses vital contextual information collected during KYC due diligence. Law enforcement has access to all of these reports from the various organizations and a single SAR may often provide the missing piece to an investigation.

- Transaction montioring staff: Your organization’s transaction monitoring staff will rely on your work. So perhaps the most important purpose of KYC is to produce documentation that others within your organization can use throughout the lifecycle of the customer relationship.

- Internal review: Finally, your customer files may be independently reviewed for quality by internal staff in your organization’s lines of business, dedicated compliance function, or audit function. They will confirm that you did enough research and that you followed appropriate policies and procedures.
