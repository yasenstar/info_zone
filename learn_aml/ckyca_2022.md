# KYC Foundations

## Background

The Trocca Case

This is you. You work in Amsterdam, at a financial institution, as a relationship manager. So we’re clear, right? You know who you are.  

This is your boss. She knows who you are, and she knows where you sit.  

Today the boss gives you a file for a new customer account. The file says the account is Trocca. You don’t know Trocca. But you know at that moment you’d rather be where they are, in the Cayman Islands.  

The file contains a copy of Trocca’s articles of incorporation, the date of incorporation, and the business address. In fact, Trocca already has an account with your institution’s affiliate branch in the Cayman Islands. The relationship manager there (does he know how lucky he is) added a note saying that Trocca represents a very important client who values his privacy and his anonymity.  

Trocca wants to transfer 20 million US dollars from its account in the Caymans to a new account in Amsterdam. Your boss is excited because she knows there’s a huge commission to be earned. She wants the best possible customer experience for Trocca because you both know they could take their business—and their big commission check—to your competitor. She tells you to open the account right away.  

So, you know what to do.

The correct choice is to escalate this case to your compliance section.  

Two of the other choices were clearly wrong. You cannot choose to do no research, or choose to wait to do research later, because both of those choices could expose your organization to incredible risk.  

In real life, if you’re a relationship manager, you might be pressured to increase profit at your firm—at the expense of skipping proper compliance steps. But, as the US regulator FinCEN says, “An institution’s interest in revenue should not compromise efforts to effectively manage and mitigate BSA AML deficiencies and risks…”  

The remaining two choices you could make both involve escalating the issue, but to very different groups. The correct answer is to escalate to a group in your organization designed to be independent and not profit-driven. That’s why escalating to your friend is not best. Your friend might be very knowledgeable, but she is not as independent as your compliance group.

Learning Objectives --

- Describe the importance of KYC, the benefits of a RBA, and the recommended KYC process

- Assess what you already know, and what you need to know, about your customer

- Explore where you can find answers to your questions

- Organize the customer information to make it meaningful

- Present the customer information in a manner appropriate to your audience

## Why KYC?

The purpose of having controls to Know Your Customer, also called KYC, is to manage the financial crime risk to your organization. In most jurisdictions, collecting customer information is also a legal and regulatory requirement. The process enables your organization to collect information on customer identity and the key customer risk factors so that you can assess the possibility of money laundering, terrorist financing, economic sanctions breaches, or customer fit that could arise from that relationship or transaction. Most organizations use three risk classification levels for customers – low, medium, and high, or a combination of them.  

Once it has KYC information, your organization can then decide, based on the risk assessment, whether it wants to accept the customer and outline mitigating factors on the identified risks, or decline the business.

### Organizations needs KYC

- Risk-based approach

- Basis of the customer profile

- Monitor future transactions

- Determine if activity is supicious

Organizations that have strong anti-financial crime programs need effective KYC controls to manage risk.  

Your organization will have determined the type of risk it is willing to accept when it does business. This is referred to as the organization's risk appetite. Once that is established, the types of risk those customer and business types will pose to your organization can be identified and classified. These risks are then analyzed to determine the appropriate controls that should be put in place to mitigate and reduce them. __These controls must be appropriate, specific, and risk based.__ Combined, this is known as a risk-based approach.  

Throughout the life of the relationship between your organization and that customer, your organization will rely on the due diligence you complete at this initial stage. Because so much emphasis is placed at the beginning of a relationship, this is the time when criminals might tailor their actions to make them appear legitimate (合法的). Money launderers and terrorist financiers might choose to wait until later to start their more suspicious activities. By undertaking reasonable and comprehensive due diligence at the initial customer acceptance stage, you develop a stronger customer profile for your organization to use later, for example when you monitor transactions to determine if a particular activity is unusual or suspicious. Having a full, complete, and up to date customer profile is essential to understand if activity is in line with expectations for the customer. In most jurisdictions (司法管辖区), there are reporting obligations in place to promptly report any suspicious activities to the authorities.

### Who is your Customer?

- Depends on jurisdiction

- A person or an organization

- User of your products

- Those you deal with regularly

Answering the question, “Who is your customer?” depends upon your jurisdiction, so research your local regulations. A customer can be an individual, listed companies, private companies, joint ventures, partnerships, and financial institutions; basically, anyone who wants to establish a relationship with your organization. If you are a financial institution, the majority of your customers will be account or product holders. They will use products such as remittances and savings accounts, or will hold an insurance policy, or will trade securities. These are people who you or your colleagues might see, speak to, or deal with on a day to day basis.

### Customers comes in many forms --

They can be individuals or entities.  

Corporate entities tend to be more complex and can take many forms. They can be privately-owned companies, publicly-owned companies, trusts, charities, and partnerships.  

A privately-owned company might be owned by a group of natural persons, or it might be owned by another company, or group of companies.  

Publicly-owned companies are quoted on stock exchanges and are collectively owned by shareholders.  

Trusts are set up to control money for beneficiaries. Examples include family trusts or trusts set up for charitable purposes. They are controlled by trustees, who are a group of individuals, or an organization that holds and administers assets for the benefit of a third party.  

Charities are incorporated for a specific purpose and have individuals that are natural persons as their controllers.  

It is likely that all of these customer types buy products or services from your organization. Sometimes your jurisdiction will set thresholds. For example, in one jurisdiction, a person buying a single low-priced product might not be considered a customer. It is essential that your organization define its customer type because jurisdictional requirements might drive everything you do to manage risk, from due diligence at the start through ongoing transaction monitoring, and in every stage of the customer relationship.

### Types of customers in financial services

Financial service customers:

- Natural person (human being)

- Legal person
  
  - Simple or complex
  
  - Company, government, etc.
  
  - Other financial institution

One type is an individual human being, or “natural person”. Natural persons may also be non-resident individuals who have a work or temporary visa.  

Another type is a “legal person.” Corporate entities are considered to be “legal persons.” They come in a variety of forms and can be complex. Some examples of corporate entities are companies, charities, trade unions, pension funds, and financial institutions.  

Government bodies and supranational organizations are also customer types. An example of a government body is Singapore's Ministry of Law. An example of a supranational organization is the World Trade Organization.

### Example customer types

- "Ordinary" person

- Politically exposed person (PEP)

- Companies take different forms
  
  - One shareholder or millions
  
  - Partnership or investment
  
  - Other financial instituion

An ordinary person requiring financial services is easy to identify as a customer type.  

A specific customer type is a politically exposed person, or PEP. A PEP is an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent function. Many PEPs hold positions that can be abused for the purpose of laundering illicit funds or other predicate offences such as corruption or bribery. A person who is a PEP, related to or connected to a PEP, is generally deemed to represent a higher risk for your organization. Your organization will have a policy on how widely you must look for this connection, including relatives and close associates.  

Companies take different forms. They can be incorporated as a limited liability company and have just one shareholder. They can be massive companies held by many investors and quoted on major stock exchanges. What a company does and where it is incorporated will also define its level of risk.  

Partnerships can be a group of individuals, such as a law firm, or investment vehicle set up to hold investor money from many sources.  

Trusts are established to hold the legal title to assets and to control them. They are often higher risk from a financial crime perspective because they can be used to mask the true owner and actual business purpose.  

Financial Institutions include banks, central banks, brokers, exchanges, insurance companies, and money transmission services. They present the full range of risks from low, in the case of many central banks, to high in money transmission services.

## Risk Overview

Types of Risk:

- Regulatory Risk: comes from failing to observe rules and guidance, thus facing fines, restriction of business, and even prison.

- Legal Risk: occurs if an organization breaks laws when doing business or faces a civil lawsuit from dissatisfied customers.

- Financial Risk: comes from the time and money it takes to undergo a regulatory investigation, to defend legal actions, to replace money lost to criminals, or to undergo a criminal prosecution.

- Reputational Risk: comes when an institution is known to have weak controls and thus is targeted by criminals. Reputational risk is difficult to quantify because consumers, shareholders, and local jurisdictions could lose confidence in the institution which could affect profitability.

Organizations that facilitate money laundering or terrorits financing, even if done inadvertently (不经意间), are likely to face all of these risks.

### Risks are often connected

- Regulatory: Multiple jurisdictions

- Legal: Sanctions, tax, AML

- Financial: Fixes, more controls

- Reputational: news and social media

Regulatory risk is complex. Many organizations operate in more than one country and therefore face multiple regulations. Typically, an organization will meet the requirements of its home regulator and make that its global standard. Where necessary, specific local regulations may overlay the global standard. Failure to meet regulatory rules can result in fines, business restrictions, or both.  

Legal risk arises from actions taken by law enforcement authorities in respect of contravention of local laws. A prosecution can be brought for sanctions breaches, assisting a customer to evade taxes, or allowing a customer to launder money through an account with your organization. Civil lawsuits (民事诉讼) can be filed for many reasons, including in response to a regulatory compliance failure.  

Financial risks come from a variety of sources. One example could be the costs of remedying a failed regulatory inspection. Legal costs might arise defending a prosecution for money laundering or defending a claim that personal data collected from customers has not been stored securely.  

Reputation risk is very hard to manage as it can be driven by a news story, including fake news. For example, in the wake of a human trafficking scandal (人口贩卖丑闻), it might be reported that your organization-maintained accounts for the traffickers and did nothing about it. As a result, customers may leave, reducing profitability. It is important to note that reputation risk can be driven by the intended actions of an organization, such as opening credit card accounts for customers without their consent.

### Regulations related to KYC

- Broadest global regulations
  
  - USA: Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)
  
  - EU: AML Directives (5th)
  
  - UK: Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Regulation (2019)

- "Extraterritorial" (治外法权)

Every country has regulations to prevent money laundering, bribery and corruption, fraud, tax evasion, and terrorist financing. Globally, the most overreaching regulations have been issued by the US, the European Union, and the United Kingdom.  

The Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, is the primary US anti-money laundering regulation. In the European Union, it is the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive. In the United Kingdom, it is The Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Regulation 2019.  

Many regulations have extraterritorial reach, meaning they apply even outside the country that issued them. Your organization will need to comply with these regulations as well as those of your home regulator.

### Laws and Guidance

- US: BSA, PATRIOT Act, FCPA

- EU: Series of AML Directives

- Financial Action Task Force (FATF)

- UK: MLTF, Bribery Act (贿赂法)

- Hong Kong: AMLO

In the USA, the BSA covers anti-money laundering, and has been amended to include certain provisions of Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act to detect, deter, and disrupt terrorist financing networks.  

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or FCPA, prohibits US companies and individuals from paying bribes to foreign officials in furtherance of a business deal. It has extraterritorial reach.

The European Union developed its 5th Money Laundering Directive based in-part on the following:

- A significant change in terrorist attacks in Europe over the previous five years

- The Panama Papers leaks, which identified the extent to which offshore accounts are used to disguise beneficial ownership

- The adoption of cryptocurrencies and other digital channels for money laundering, which are currently unregulated sectors

The EU’s intent is to ensure the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, anti-money laundering recommendations are implemented. FATF is an inter-governmental body that sets international standards that aim to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing and the harm they cause to society.  

The UK’s Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) Regulations 2019 is wider than the EU Directive. It requires organizations to include new additional high-risk factors when assessing the need for enhanced due diligence, to seek additional information, and to increase monitoring in certain cases.  

The Bribery Act 2010 is UK legislation that also has extraterritorial reach.  

An example of a regional regulation is the Hong Kong Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance, AMLO, that highlights internal controls, processes, considerations, monitoring, and reporting requirements on covered persons and entities.

## Risk Categories

### 4 Categories of Risk

- Customer

- Jurisdiction

- Product

- Channel

An overall customer risk rating is usually derived as a composite of the following four categories of risk in money laundering prevention: Customer, Jurisdiction, Product, and Channel.  

The risk associated with the customer can be higher if the customer is nonresident, if the customer’s legal structure is complex, if the customer is in an industry often exploited for (被利用) financial crime, or if the customer’s business is cash-intensive.  

Some jurisdictions are higher risk because their own laws, regulations, and enforcement controls to prevent financial crime are weak, or nonexistent.  

Each product or service carries a different level of risk. For example, private banking is considered higher risk, as transactions may be confidential and attempt to mask true ownership.  

Channel risk increases with non-face-to-face business relationships or transactions, or when payments are sent to or received from unknown or unassociated third parties.

### Examples of higher risks

- Customer: Non-resident, complex owner

- Jurisdiction: Low regulation, tax haven

- Product: Prepaid card, private banking

- Channel: No direct relationship with customer

Customers can be higher risk if they use nominee shareholders, shares in bearer form, or a company ownership structure that is very complex. In many countries, bearer shares are banned because of their potential for abuse as tax evasion and money laundering. Also, high risk are customers who conduct their business relationship with your organization at a geographic distance, which is not explained. For example, a foreign citizen, with no connection to a country where an account is being opened, requires explanation. Your organization might have a list of industries or customer types considered higher-risk which automatically get additional scrutiny.  

Higher risk jurisdictions, as defined by the **Financial Action Task Force**, are countries that have been identified as having strategic deficiencies in their national anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regimes. They pose significant threats to the global financial system.  

Certain products are higher risk. An example would be reloading a prepaid device via a kiosk at a gas station. Others are lower risk. An example is providing a small amount of foreign currency to an existing customer for a holiday abroad.  

Some delivery channels are higher risk. Correspondent banking relationships create significant money laundering and terrorist financing risks because the domestic bank carrying out the transaction has to rely on the foreign bank to identify the customer, determine the real owners, and monitor such transactions for risks.

### Customer Risk and Red Flags

- Who, what they do, source of funds or wealth

- Example: Cash-intensive business might deposit drug cash

- Unexpected behavior is red flag

Some customers present higher inherent risk to your organization because of who they are, what they do, the industry they are in, the businesses they run, or their source of funds or wealth. Look for a business model that could bring cash from illegal drug sales into the financial system, such as a car wash or other typically cash-intensive business.  

Look for activity that is inconsistent with their expected behavior. For example, a natural person who is a paralegal  (律师助理) is paid every two weeks via direct deposit for US\$2,000. If she later transfers US\$144,000 into the account from an outside account, it would raise a red flag. The source of funds and source of wealth must be explained and verified.  

Other red flags could include indicators of money mules, fraud, or performing banking transactions on behalf of others who do not wish their true identity to be known.

### Assessing Customer Risk

- Status and profession

- Type and size of business

- Industry

- Uncooperative when asked questions

- Red flags are not always permanent

When assessing the risk posed by a customer, it is important to check their status and what they do. A customer who frequently visits a bank branch to change small denomination bank notes for larger ones raises a red flag. Illegal drug sales are often cash-based, small transactions. What does the customer do? Is there a good reason for this activity?  

Actions inconsistent with the customer’s business also warrant attention. Red flags might include a sudden change in the currency transaction patterns of a business which is inconsistent with its normal activities. Or a retail business that has dramatically different patterns of cash deposits from similar businesses in the same general location. Or a business with no apparent or significant online sales which receives large frequent payments from an online payments system.  

Certain industries are often exploited by financial criminals. Examples include charities, high-value goods dealers, casinos, and real estate agents. There is usually not one shared attribute about those industries that makes them higher-risk, so using a list of them to guide your risk assessment is a best practice.  

Any customer who will not cooperate, or who refuses to provide satisfactory proof of how the source of funds or source of wealth was obtained, raises a further red flag.  

Not all red flags are permanent. You might discover, for example, that your customer has the same name as someone who is listed on an official register for crimes or sanctions. If, after further investigation, you confirm that your customer is not on that register, you can clear the red flag.

### Politically Exposed Person (PEP, 政治公众人物) Risk and Red Flags

A PEP is a politically exposed person. According to Financial Action Task Force (FATF) there are two types of PEPs:

- Foreign PEPs are individuals who are or have been entrusted (委托) with prominent (著名的) public functions by a foreign country

- Domestic PEPs are individuals who are or have been entrusted domestically with prominent public functions

PEPs tend to be heads of state or heads of government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state-owned corporations, and important political party officials. Usually, PEP positions are specified in each jurisdiction's AML regulation.  

Immediate family members, relatives, and close associates may also be classified as PEPs.

### PEPs are high-risk

Individuals in high positions and their associates are more vulnerable to corruption.  

Corruption might be quid-pro-quo favors (交换条件) where the PEP directs government contracts to an organization in return for kickbacks. In addition, a PEP might influence legislation for bribes, or even flee the country with government funds.  

In defining a PEP, it is wise to use a broad definition that includes the positions that make a person a PEP, as well as their immediate family members and close associates.  

Under a risk-based approach, PEP risk is manageable. If a customer discloses during the KYC, or Know Your Customer process, that he is the husband of a government official, it may be wise to classify him as a PEP regardless of whether he would qualify under your institution's PEP definition. This will depend on your organization’s internal policies. The additional expenditure of resources will often be justified by the protection you get from the investigation.  

When it comes to identifying PEPs, your organization only needs to use the information which is both in your possession and publicly known. Depending on the size of your organization, this may also include the use of a proprietary database for name **screening**.

### Shell Company risk and Red flags

- No assets or operations

- "Shelf" is shell created to use later

- Appear legitimate and mask ownership

- Sometimes legitimate but high-risk

- Often facilitate money laundering

A shell company or corporation is a company that, at the time of incorporation, has no significant assets or operations. A similarly named "shelf" company is a corporation that has had no activity. It has been created and put "on the shelf" so that it can be sold later to someone who prefers a previously registered corporation over a new one. Both shell and shelf companies are generally kept dormant, and are used later to appear legitimate, while masking the beneficial owner. While there are legitimate uses for shell companies, within the context of researching and accepting customers, shell and shelf companies are considered high-risk.  

Shell companies can be established with the primary objective to claim the proceeds of crime as legitimate revenue or to commingle criminal proceeds with legitimate revenue. According to Financial Action Task Force, the use of shell companies to facilitate money laundering is a well-documented typology.

### Shell company is high-risk

- Sometimes "offshore"

- Complex ownership

- Legally registered

- Corporate servfice providers

- Bearer shares identify owner

- Concealed (暗) by secrecy (保密) laws

Shell companies can be set up in onshore and offshore locations.

Their ownership structures can take several forms

- Shares can be issued to a natural or legal person or in registered or bearer form

- Some shell companies can be created for a single purpose or to hold a single asset

- Some shell companies can be established as multipurpose entities

Shell companies are often legally incorporated and registered by the criminal organization but have no legitimate business purpose. Often purchased from lawyers, accountants or non-reputable corporate service providers, they are convenient vehicles to launder money.  

Sometimes, the stock of these shell corporations is issued in bearer shares, which means that whoever carries them is the purported owner. Tax haven countries and their strict secrecy laws can further conceal the true ownership of shell corporations. In addition, the information may be held by professionals who claim secrecy.  

When FATF reviewed the rules and practices that impair the effectiveness of money laundering prevention and detection systems, it found in particular that shell corporations and nominees are widely used mechanisms to launder the proceeds from crime. As a result, shell companies are considered to represent a higher risk of financial crime.

### Jurisdiction Risk and Red Flags

- Corrupt, unstable governments

- Secrecy, tax, laundering havens (避风港)

- Drug production and cartels (合作社)

- Inadequate AML/CFT controls

Certain countries or jurisdictions have high levels of corruption or unstable governments. Some are known as secrecy and money laundering havens or suffer from high levels of drug production and cartel activities. It’s important to consider the inherent risk in the jurisdictions where you do business.

Jurisdictions with higher risk include those

- With poor anti-money laundering regulations

- With high levels of corruption

- With inadequate regulatory and judicial frameworks to prevent terror-financing

- That are subject to economic sanctions

- That are considered to be tax havens

- That host shell companies

Examples include tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands, or the Cayman Islands. Other examples include whole countries, such as North Korea.

### Sources for assessing jurisdiction risk

- Transparency International

- US International Narcotics Control Strategy Report

- Sanctions and terror lists

- FATF member or regional body

- Regional risks

You should look for red flags related to jurisdiction risk. Excellent sources include Transparency International’s “Corruption Perceptions Index” and the US State Department’s annual International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, which rates countries based on their money laundering controls and corruption.  

You should review sanctions and terrorist financing lists published by governments and international organizations such as OFAC, HM Treasury in the UK, the UN Security Council, the US FinCEN, and the EU.  

Determine if the country is a member of Financial Action Task Force or of a FATF-style regional body, and has implemented practices in line with international standards.  

Take into account regional risks inside a particular country, such as port cities, free trade zones, the cross-border areas between nations, or designated areas of high intensity financial crime or drug trafficking. If the countries where you operate do not provide information on such high-risk crime areas, you can research your own list from media and other available sources.

### Product Risk and Red Flags

- High inherent risk
  
  - Private bank source of funds

- Higher risk if used in a certai way
  
  - Quickly cancelled / refunded
  
  - Paid for by third parties

Some financial products carry a higher risk when used by customers in a certain way.  

For example, private wealth services assist to manage the funds of wealthy customers. If a customer is also a politically exposed person, a red flag is raised. This is because their wealth might not be justifiable and might have been obtained through bribery, corruption, or theft.  

Financial products that are paid for immediately but can be cancelled within a certain period for a full refund are high risk. An insurance policy that is redeemed too soon should raise a red flag.  

Third parties making or receiving payments raise a red flag. Criminals often use third parties to make payments on their behalf as a way of disguising the sources of funds.

### Assessing product risk

- Coverting cash into other forms

- Selling long term products quickly - even for a loss

- Third-party involvement

Customers buying large value pre-paid cards might raise a red flag unless there is a good reason.  

Longer term investment products, which are liquid and can be bought and sold easily, raise a red flag if the customer does not hold them for long and is unconcerned about losses.  

Trade finance, which is the provision of financing or credit for trade transactions, is a high-risk product. Red flags are raised if a payment to the seller is made by an unrelated third party. For example, the customer might misclassify the commodity, over value or under value it.

### Product risk - Case example

- Potential private bank customer wants to buy stocks
  
  - US\$250,000 property sale
  
  - US\$9,000 cash from income

- Red Flags: PEP, structuring, cash deposits

The private banking department opens an investment account for a new customer. He has control of the portfolio, and your organization advises him. He wants to buy highly liquid stocks and shares. He deposits US$250,000 from a property sale now, from another bank, and says he will add US$9,900 in cash, every month going forward. His identity is verified. He is the Inspector of Buildings for the state department of works. This is a local government position. He is responsible for signing the fire safety certificates for large building developments. He says the money for the monthly deposit will come from private consultancy work he undertakes for major construction companies. Despite these explanations, and verified identity, there are red flags. He might be a politically exposed person, due to his position with the local government. His monthly payments must be challenged.

Private banking is a high-risk product because it tends to attract high net worth customers who value their privacy. Some private banking customers could be PEPs.  

While the amount he uses to open the account can be verified by inquiry, the monthly cash deposit is a red flag. Many jurisdictions have a cap on how much money can be deposited or withdrawn in cash before a currency transaction report must be made. In your jurisdiction, the limit is US$10,000. The customer wishes to deposit an amount just below this. Is this deliberate?  

The customer holds an important role in local government. That could make him a senior government official, and therefore a politically exposed person, and high risk.  

The customer has been very open about what he does. Could he be accepting bribes from the construction companies to give the fire safety certificates without making the proper checks and disguising it as advisory fees?  

Do you think it unusual for a senior expert giving specialist advice to a major company to be paid in cash and in such a large amount?  

The customer’s identity has been verified. You can allocate him PEP status in your records. You must ask for proof of the property sale, a copy of the contract for his advisory services, and permission from his employer to take on separate employment.  

Note that being a PEP is not a crime and should not be treated as such. The risk presented to the firm by a PEP is higher; therefore, additional controls may be applied.

### Channel Risk and Red Flags

- Risk from sale or delivery method

- Risk increases
  
  - Non-face-to-face
  
  - Transactions with unknown 3rd parties

Channel risk is the inherent risk posed by the method in which an institution’s products are delivered. It is also known as delivery channel risk. Channel risk increases with non-face-to-face business relationships or transactions or when payments are sent to or received from unknown or unassociated third parties.

### Assessing Channel Risk

- Higher risk if identity obscured

- Higher risk if different standards

- Maintain confidentiality

Other examples of high-risk delivery channels include

- Correspondent banks, payable through accounts, and concentration accounts

- Remote transactions

You need to include additional risk arising from channels in your Customer Risk Rating Model.

If your organization allows for customers to open accounts without being physically present, then additional controls are needed to mitigate the risk of identity fraud or deception. Here are some criteria taken from the European Union’s Anti-Money Laundering Directive:

- Establish the customer’s identity by additional documents, data, or information

- Add verification measures, including certification of documents by another organization

- Require that the first payment to the account is from an account held by that customer at an organization subject to the same standard of controls—maybe even at a sister branch

- Never agree to open accounts for fictitious, anonymous, or numbered entities. However, privacy is a right and regulatory obligation in many jurisdictions. Organizations should limit the employees who know which customers have accounts. Furthermore, employees are not allowed to share account holder identities with family, friends, or even coworkers unless on a need-to-know basis.

## Risk-Based Approach (RBA)

### RBA to Business

Risk Appetite: Every organization has its own appetite for risk. This determines the type of customer it will accept, the types of product it will offer, and the jurisdictions in which it will do business.  

Risk-Rating: Once this is established, the organization will allocate a risk rating to these categories. For example, an individual customer with a regular job and a salary opening a savings account would be low risk, assuming the source of funds can be corroborated and there is no relevant, negative news. A Politically Exposed Person, or PEP, is higher risk. Products and jurisdictions also present a range of risks.  

Use Resources Wisely: Using a risk-based approach allows your organization to effectively use its resources by classifying customers based on the level of perceived risk that they could pose from a financial crime perspective.  

Those decisions drive the level and frequency of customer research and updating the customer profile.

### RBA is now a regulatory expectation

Risk Assessment: Risk assessment as a whole has become more important in recent years because the fight against financial crime has taken a more holistic approach, with regulators emphasizing a risk-based approach to every way you interact with your customers.  

Risk Level: Accurately judging the risk level that a customer might be involved in laundering money is an important prerequisite for the “risk-based” approach. Financial institutions need to conduct due diligence on business operations, industries, customer characteristics, and regions, in order to obtain adequate, complete, and truthful customer information as the basis of analysis.  

Focus Effort: A risk-based approach focuses effort where it is most needed and will have most impact. It requires the full commitment and support of senior management, and the active cooperation of all employees.  

Manage Risk: Adopting a risk-based approach implies the adoption of a risk-management process for dealing with money laundering and terrorist financing. This process encompasses recognizing the existence of the risks, undertaking an assessment of the risks, and developing control strategies to mitigate and monitor the identified risks.  

Mitigate the Highest Risks: Money laundering risk is just one element of risk financial institutions face. Others include credit risk and market risk. Combining the management of these risks enables risk managers to assess the financial crime risk and devote resources to mitigating the highest risks.

### Controlling Risk

- Controls are critical to success

- Risk assessment guides controls

- 3 categories: Preventive, Detective, Corrective

Controlling risk is critical to the overall success of an institution. Financial crime risk assessments help to develop control strategies to mitigate and monitor the identified risks. Some examples of these control strategies are policies and procedures, training, four eyes checks, and segregation of duties. These controls fall into three categories: preventive, detective, and corrective.

### Internal Control Framework

An internal control framework is the process through which an organization obtains reasonable assurance that it is achieving its objectives in relation to its operations, reporting, and compliance.  

The five components of the internal control framework are the overall control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring.  

The overall control environment is the set of standards, processes, and structures that provide the basis for carrying out internal control across the organization.  

A money laundering risk assessment measures the likelihood or probability that the business will unwittingly engage in money laundering or terror financing. The risk assessment identifies inherent risks, the effectiveness of existing controls, and captures the residual risk.  

Control activities in financial crime prevention include preventive, detective, and corrective controls.

- Preventive controls include robust due diligence, record keeping, and record retention.

- Detective controls include reporting suspicious activity to the appropriate authorities.

- Corrective controls include the eventual exiting of a customer relationship where necessary.  

Information and communication include proper training for employees, third-party providers, and the board of directors. Regular updates should be given when money laundering typologies evolve, so that front line staff know what to look for.  

The final element of risk control is monitoring. This is usually undertaken by a separate department (such as Internal Audit) or independent assurance within the business or the compliance lines, who will test that all policies, procedures, and controls have been properly observed and applied.

### Residual risk equation

Residual risk = Inherent risk - Controlled risk

Financial institutions measure risk by conducting a risk assessment.  

You can use the equation: Inherent Risk – Controlled Risk = Residual Risk  

Inherent risk is the risk before controls are applied. Inherent risk generally takes into account the risk factors of Customer, Jurisdiction, Product, and Channel.  

All of that comes together to create inherent risk (固有风险).  

The next part of the equation is Controlled Risk. Your organization has many controls, including customer due diligence, governance, training, adequate staffing, testing, and transaction monitoring.  

Residual risk is the risk that remains after you implement effective controls.

### Inherent Risks and Controls

To understand inherent risk, it is important to know the specific risks associated with each risk factor.  

1. Customer: Customer risk can be higher if the customer is a non-resident, if the customer’s legal structure is complex, or if the customer’s business is cash-intensive.  

2. Jurisdiction: Jurisdictions with higher risk include those with poor anti-money laundering regulations or areas with high levels of corruption.  

3. Product: Each product or service carries a different level of risk. For example private banking is considered higher risk, as transactions may be confidential in an attempt to mask true ownership.  

4. Channel: Channel risk increases with non-face-to-face business relationships or transactions, or when payments are sent to or received from unknown or unassociated third parties.  

Your organization has established a set of controls to help mitigate inherent risk. **KYC controls include customer identification, customer due diligence, management approvals, and dual controls**. In addition, your organization should have carefully documented policies and procedures, and carefully documented research to know your customer.

### RBA to KYC (Initial and Ongoing)

- Identify risk from each customer

- Defined by your risk appetite

- High, medium, low, and perhaps more

- KYC is ongoing

A risk-based approach to KYC helps you identify the risks each customer brings to your organization in respect to possible money laundering and terrorist financing risk. **The risk-based approach is defined by your organization’s risk appetite (风险偏好), or the level of risk your organization is willing to accept based on its strategic objectives.**

The risk-based approach categorizes customers into levels of risk: such as high, medium, low, and perhaps more levels based on the policies of your organization. The level of risk determines the amount and type of due diligence you must do.

KYC is an ongoing effort. Your institution will have risk-based time frames for conducting periodic reviews. For example, customers might be reviewed annually if they are high risk, at two years for medium risk, and every three years if they are low risk. The frequency will vary based on your organization's policies.

### Risk-based KYC benefits

- Regulators advise RBA

- Resource allocation

- Ongoing reviews ensure risk classification is appropriate

Regulators want you to apply a risk-based approach. They want you to understand your customer because you have done a sufficient amount of research, and you have documented all that research.  

The risk-based approach sets out the process for you to collect information about the identity of the customer and the key customer risk factors, and to assess the risk that could arise from that relationship or transaction.  

An example is the due diligence required for opening a simple checking account. Without a risk-based approach, a senior citizen from New York wanting to deposit his pension checks would be subject to the same due diligence process as a politically exposed person who is part of a foreign government wanting to deposit a large amount of funds.  

**KYC does not end after onboarding a customer**. Depending on the risk classification of the customer, there should be ongoing monitoring of customer transactions and a regular, periodic review of the customer's profile. Note that customers might not remain in the same risk category throughout their relationship with your organization. For example, an ordinary individual might run for local government office and, if elected, become a PEP. That would change their risk classification from low to medium or high, based upon the role they perform.
