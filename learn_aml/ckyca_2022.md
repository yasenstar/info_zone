# KYC Foundations

## Background

The Trocca Case

This is you. You work in Amsterdam, at a financial institution, as a relationship manager. So we’re clear, right? You know who you are.  

This is your boss. She knows who you are, and she knows where you sit.  

Today the boss gives you a file for a new customer account. The file says the account is Trocca. You don’t know Trocca. But you know at that moment you’d rather be where they are, in the Cayman Islands.  

The file contains a copy of Trocca’s articles of incorporation, the date of incorporation, and the business address. In fact, Trocca already has an account with your institution’s affiliate branch in the Cayman Islands. The relationship manager there (does he know how lucky he is) added a note saying that Trocca represents a very important client who values his privacy and his anonymity.  

Trocca wants to transfer 20 million US dollars from its account in the Caymans to a new account in Amsterdam. Your boss is excited because she knows there’s a huge commission to be earned. She wants the best possible customer experience for Trocca because you both know they could take their business—and their big commission check—to your competitor. She tells you to open the account right away.  

So, you know what to do.

The correct choice is to escalate this case to your compliance section.  

Two of the other choices were clearly wrong. You cannot choose to do no research, or choose to wait to do research later, because both of those choices could expose your organization to incredible risk.  

In real life, if you’re a relationship manager, you might be pressured to increase profit at your firm—at the expense of skipping proper compliance steps. But, as the US regulator FinCEN says, “An institution’s interest in revenue should not compromise efforts to effectively manage and mitigate BSA AML deficiencies and risks…”  

The remaining two choices you could make both involve escalating the issue, but to very different groups. The correct answer is to escalate to a group in your organization designed to be independent and not profit-driven. That’s why escalating to your friend is not best. Your friend might be very knowledgeable, but she is not as independent as your compliance group.

## Why KYC?

The purpose of having controls to Know Your Customer, also called KYC, is to manage the financial crime risk to your organization. In most jurisdictions, collecting customer information is also a legal and regulatory requirement. The process enables your organization to collect information on customer identity and the key customer risk factors so that you can assess the possibility of money laundering, terrorist financing, economic sanctions breaches, or customer fit that could arise from that relationship or transaction. Most organizations use three risk classification levels for customers – low, medium, and high, or a combination of them.  

Once it has KYC information, your organization can then decide, based on the risk assessment, whether it wants to accept the customer and outline mitigating factors on the identified risks, or decline the business.

### Organizations needs KYC

- Risk-based approach

- Basis of the customer profile

- Monitor future transactions

- Determine if activity is supicious

Organizations that have strong anti-financial crime programs need effective KYC controls to manage risk.  

Your organization will have determined the type of risk it is willing to accept when it does business. This is referred to as the organization's risk appetite. Once that is established, the types of risk those customer and business types will pose to your organization can be identified and classified. These risks are then analyzed to determine the appropriate controls that should be put in place to mitigate and reduce them. __These controls must be appropriate, specific, and risk based.__ Combined, this is known as a risk-based approach.  

Throughout the life of the relationship between your organization and that customer, your organization will rely on the due diligence you complete at this initial stage. Because so much emphasis is placed at the beginning of a relationship, this is the time when criminals might tailor their actions to make them appear legitimate (合法的). Money launderers and terrorist financiers might choose to wait until later to start their more suspicious activities. By undertaking reasonable and comprehensive due diligence at the initial customer acceptance stage, you develop a stronger customer profile for your organization to use later, for example when you monitor transactions to determine if a particular activity is unusual or suspicious. Having a full, complete, and up to date customer profile is essential to understand if activity is in line with expectations for the customer. In most jurisdictions (司法管辖区), there are reporting obligations in place to promptly report any suspicious activities to the authorities.

### Who is your Customer?

- Depends on jurisdiction

- A person or an organization

- User of your products

- Those you deal with regularly

Answering the question, “Who is your customer?” depends upon your jurisdiction, so research your local regulations. A customer can be an individual, listed companies, private companies, joint ventures, partnerships, and financial institutions; basically, anyone who wants to establish a relationship with your organization. If you are a financial institution, the majority of your customers will be account or product holders. They will use products such as remittances and savings accounts, or will hold an insurance policy, or will trade securities. These are people who you or your colleagues might see, speak to, or deal with on a day to day basis.

### Customers comes in many forms --

They can be individuals or entities.  

Corporate entities tend to be more complex and can take many forms. They can be privately-owned companies, publicly-owned companies, trusts, charities, and partnerships.  

A privately-owned company might be owned by a group of natural persons, or it might be owned by another company, or group of companies.  

Publicly-owned companies are quoted on stock exchanges and are collectively owned by shareholders.  

Trusts are set up to control money for beneficiaries. Examples include family trusts or trusts set up for charitable purposes. They are controlled by trustees, who are a group of individuals, or an organization that holds and administers assets for the benefit of a third party.  

Charities are incorporated for a specific purpose and have individuals that are natural persons as their controllers.  

It is likely that all of these customer types buy products or services from your organization. Sometimes your jurisdiction will set thresholds. For example, in one jurisdiction, a person buying a single low-priced product might not be considered a customer. It is essential that your organization define its customer type because jurisdictional requirements might drive everything you do to manage risk, from due diligence at the start through ongoing transaction monitoring, and in every stage of the customer relationship.

### Types of customers in financial services

Financial service customers:

- Natural person (human being)

- Legal person
  
  - Simple or complex
  
  - Company, government, etc.
  
  - Other financial institution

One type is an individual human being, or “natural person”. Natural persons may also be non-resident individuals who have a work or temporary visa.  

Another type is a “legal person.” Corporate entities are considered to be “legal persons.” They come in a variety of forms and can be complex. Some examples of corporate entities are companies, charities, trade unions, pension funds, and financial institutions.  

Government bodies and supranational organizations are also customer types. An example of a government body is Singapore's Ministry of Law. An example of a supranational organization is the World Trade Organization.

### Example customer types

- "Ordinary" person

- Politically exposed person (PEP)

- Companies take different forms
  
  - One shareholder or millions
  
  - Partnership or investment
  
  - Other financial instituion

An ordinary person requiring financial services is easy to identify as a customer type.  

A specific customer type is a politically exposed person, or PEP. A PEP is an individual who is or has been entrusted with a prominent function. Many PEPs hold positions that can be abused for the purpose of laundering illicit funds or other predicate offences such as corruption or bribery. A person who is a PEP, related to or connected to a PEP, is generally deemed to represent a higher risk for your organization. Your organization will have a policy on how widely you must look for this connection, including relatives and close associates.  

Companies take different forms. They can be incorporated as a limited liability company and have just one shareholder. They can be massive companies held by many investors and quoted on major stock exchanges. What a company does and where it is incorporated will also define its level of risk.  

Partnerships can be a group of individuals, such as a law firm, or investment vehicle set up to hold investor money from many sources.  

Trusts are established to hold the legal title to assets and to control them. They are often higher risk from a financial crime perspective because they can be used to mask the true owner and actual business purpose.  

Financial Institutions include banks, central banks, brokers, exchanges, insurance companies, and money transmission services. They present the full range of risks from low, in the case of many central banks, to high in money transmission services.

## Risk Overview

Types of Risk:

- Regulatory Risk: comes from failing to observe rules and guidance, thus facing fines, restriction of business, and even prison.

- Legal Risk: occurs if an organization breaks laws when doing business or faces a civil lawsuit from dissatisfied customers.

- Financial Risk: comes from the time and money it takes to undergo a regulatory investigation, to defend legal actions, to replace money lost to criminals, or to undergo a criminal prosecution.

- Reputational Risk: comes when an institution is known to have weak controls and thus is targeted by criminals. Reputational risk is difficult to quantify because consumers, shareholders, and local jurisdictions could lose confidence in the institution which could affect profitability.

Organizations that facilitate money laundering or terrorits financing, even if done inadvertently (不经意间), are likely to face all of these risks.
