### How to copy a SharePoint subsite

In browser, after your site URL, add `/_layouts/15/sitemanager.aspx`, you will see the `Site Settings > Site Content and Structure` window.

From this screen, you can position one subsite and either copy or move it.

Limitation: only allowed to copy/move within same site collection!
